# Playwright Test Setup Summary

## What Was Set Up

1. **Playwright Installation**

   - Installed `@playwright/test` as a dev dependency
   - Installed Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Added `dotenv` for environment variable management

2. **Configuration Files**

   - `playwright.config.ts` - Main Playwright configuration
   - `.env.test` - Test environment variables template
   - `tests/global-setup.ts` - Global test setup (for database seeding)

3. **Test Files**

   - `tests/auth.spec.ts` - Comprehensive registration tests (requires database)
   - `tests/auth-simple.spec.ts` - UI-only tests (no database required)
   - `tests/README.md` - Documentation for running tests

4. **NPM Scripts Added**
   ```json
   "test": "playwright test",
   "test:ui": "playwright test --ui",
   "test:debug": "playwright test --debug",
   "test:report": "playwright show-report"
   ```

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start (UI Tests Only)

```bash
# Run the simple UI tests that don't require database
pnpm test tests/auth-simple.spec.ts
```

### Full Test Suite (Requires Database)

1. Set up your database and update `.env.local` with proper credentials
2. Run database migrations: `pnpm prisma db push`
3. Run all tests: `pnpm test`

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Best for development - shows tests running in real browser
pnpm test:ui
```

## Test Coverage

### UI Tests (auth-simple.spec.ts)

- Form element visibility
- Real-time email validation
- Password strength indicator
- Password confirmation matching
- Navigation between pages
- Form submission loading states

### Full Integration Tests (auth.spec.ts)

- All UI tests plus:
- Successful user registration
- Duplicate email handling
- Database integration
- Authentication flow

## Known Issues

1. **Environment Variables**: The app requires `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET` to be set. Without these, you'll see errors in the console.

2. **System Dependencies**: Some Linux systems may need additional libraries for Playwright browsers. Run `pnpm exec playwright install-deps` if needed.

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the test suite:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database
2. Copy `.env.test` to `.env.local` and update with real values
3. Run `pnpm prisma db push` to create database schema
4. Run `pnpm test` to execute all tests

The tests are ready to use and will help ensure the registration flow works correctly as you develop the application.
